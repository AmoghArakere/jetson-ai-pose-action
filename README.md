# Jetson AI Pose and Action Recognition

This project implements pose estimation using **BlazePose** and action recognition using **Temporal Shift Module (TSM)** on Jetson devices.


>Pose-estimation: BlazePose-based implementation for pose estimation.
>Action-recognition: TSM-based implementation for action recognition.

## Setup
Before you begin, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. Run the following command to install them:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision opencv-python numpy matplotlib mediapipe ipython
```

Usage :
> Pose Estimation:
Navigate to the pose-estimation folder.
Upload a sample video in the same directory.
Run the script to perform pose estimation using BlazePose.

>Action Recognition:
Navigate to the action-recognition folder.
Upload a sample video in the same directory.
Run the script to perform action recognition using Temporal Shift Module (TSM).
